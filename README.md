This is the repository to keep track of the papers discussed during the ML reading group

## Posts

### File Format

Each post has a corresponsing markdown file (.md/.markdown) with a specific naming format:
```
yyyy-mm-dd-name-of-post.md
```
where the date is the date of the meeting when the paper was or will be discussed.

### Adding a post

To create a new post simply create a new file according to the naming format and add it in the `_posts` directory. 

The first few lines of the file provided the necessary infomation to make the page and should look like this:
```
---
layout: post
title:  "Full title of the paper"
date:   yyyy-mm-dd
categories: paper
---
```
The rest of file will contain the text displayed in the post. The abstract of the paper should be included and any other information or links that may be useful.
